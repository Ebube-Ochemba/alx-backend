> This project was Caching.

## Summary

I learnt about what a caching system is, `FIFO`, `LIFO`, `LRU`, `MRU`, `LFU`, the purpose of a caching system, and the limits a caching system has.

- All classes must inherit from [`BaseCaching`](./base_caching.py)

- [x] [0-basic_cache.py](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-backend/blob/main/0x01-caching/0-basic_cache.py): A class `BasicCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and is a caching system. It implements a basic caching system.
- [x] [1-fifo_cache.py](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-backend/blob/main/0x01-caching/1-fifo_cache.py): A class `FIFOCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and is a caching system. It implements the `FIFO` (First-In, First-Out) eviction policy.
- [x] [2-lifo_cache.py](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-backend/blob/main/0x01-caching/2-lifo_cache.py): A class `LIFOCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and is a caching system. It implements the `LIFO` (Last-In, First-Out) eviction policy.
- [x] [3-lru_cache.py](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-backend/blob/main/0x01-caching/3-lru_cache.py): A class `LRUCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and is a caching system. It implements the `LRU` (Least Recently Used) eviction policy.
- [ ] [4-mru_cache.py](https://github.com/Ebube-Ochemba/alx-backend/blob/main/0x01-caching/4-mru_cache.py): A class `MRUCache` that inherits from `BaseCaching` and is a caching system.
